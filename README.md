# Shift Notes
__*Shift Notes*__ is a note taking app built for ShiftKey Lab's React Native certification. This repository is a fork of ShiftKey's starter project fort he course. The app will allow users to write notes, save them, modify them and delete them. I also want to add a sharing feature so users can export their note and send it to their contacts and share their thoughts, gift ideas or grocery list.

## Installation
Since this repository is my fork, you might be better checking out the [ShiftKey Labs Notion](https://shiftkeylabs.notion.site/Project-Install-Instructions-f937641104bc42e098fcfefcf7349608) for detailed installation instructions if you want to build your own version of the app.

Otherwise, here are the steps to install my fork if you'd rather use mine:

1) **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sp0k/ShiftNotes.git
cd ShiftNotes
```
2) **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
Since this project uses **Expo** instead of Metro, you should make sure to use npm for any of the command you plan to use to install new dependencies or to run the server for example.

3) **Set up the environment:**

If you haven't already, make sure set up the React Native environment for your computer. To do so, follow the React Native environment setup guide for your operating system: [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Usage
Like stated before, the project uses **Expo** instead of metro, so you will need to use npm instead or yarn. In order to be able to view the app, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```
This will start the server and give you a QR code you can scan with your phone if you want to open the app on your phone using the *Expo Go* app. The server can also be opened on simulators on your computer and on the web.

## Contributing
Sadly, contributions are __not__ welcomed on this repository because it is a course project for a certification. Please feel free to clone my project and modify for yourself, but do keep in mind that I cannot accept your contribution.

## License
I don't think the project has any license as it is a fork as well as a course project. I am not sure how much of my code could be reused in this situation without causing problems.
